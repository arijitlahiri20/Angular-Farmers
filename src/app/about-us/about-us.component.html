      The Government of India provides various schemes for farmers, but due to lack
      of awareness and miscommunication, farmers do not avail these benefits. Hence,
      this service tries to integrate some of the schemes like Fasal Bima Yojna and Bidding of
      Crops scheme.

  <div class="ml-auto p-1">
      This service implements a system which is automated and helps to reduce the
      burden on farmers as well as the system by providing an online means to
      apply and claim insurance which will help the system to work efficiently and
      enhance smooth handling of records.

      The bidding module will enable the farmer to place crops for auction and receive
      best price from auction which stabilizes the farmerâ€™s income as well as eliminates
      the stress of physical sale of crops in the market. The implementation of these two
      modules will help the farmer to make use of technology and reduce the
      efforts for selling the crops.
